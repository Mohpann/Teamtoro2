This project was built using ReactJS in a NodeJS environment and developed on an AWS EC2 instance. 

## Motivation

I had heard a lot about the extensive use of ReactJS by front end developers because of its developer friendly features. Because of this, I felt that it was time to learn how to make a website from scratch using React. 

## What Is This Website?

I built this web app from Greenfield as a revamp to Team Toro Muay Thai's previous website that used older technologies. This website is now deployed as the main Team Toro Muay Thai website. Team Toro is a Muay Thai gym in Westmont, Illinois that trains professional and amateur fighters. 

## What Was Learned?

I learned a lot building this website. I went into it with no web dev experience and came out feeling relatively comfortable with the basics of builidng a web app with React. I learned how to use ReactRouter, so switching between pages is a little faster than the old website, I got comfortable creating and styling React components with JSX, utilized React Bootstrap components and styling, and adapted an external email package to create a working contact form, among other things.
